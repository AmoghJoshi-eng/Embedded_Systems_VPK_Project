Pulse Measurement setup is a micro-controller based pulse measuring system which can be used to monitor pulse of human and analyse their health.
Pulse Measurement wearable setup based on Ayurvedic NADI PARIKSHAN is a micro-controller based pulse measuring system which can be used to monitor pulse of human. Setup designed has the added advantage of being wearable and the waveforms at each point are monitored in real-time on Serial Plotter as well as displayed on a GUI based webpage for intuitive analysis
